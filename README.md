# HollowKnight.SkillUpgrades

Mod that upgrades some skills. Includes:

#### Multiple Wings: Use wings more than once in the air.
Manually set the value in the global settings file to the number of times you can double jump before landing, or -1 for infinite.

#### Multiple Air Dash: Dash more than once before landing.
Manually set the value in the global settings file to the number of times you can dash before landing, or -1 for infinite.

#### Directional Dash: Dash in the 8 cardinal directions.
Two options can be toggled in the global settings. 
- By default, the knight maintains its vertical momentum out of an upward/diagonal dash - this behaviour can be disabled (so the knight will stop completely, much like a horizontal dash)
- By default, the knight can dash in all 8 directions - the ability to dash down-diagonally can be disabled (down-diagonal dashes will be replaced with horizontal dashes).

#### Vertical Cdash: Cdash vertically and diagonally.
Hold up when releasing from a ground charge to cdash upwards. Hold up as well as the direction you're facing (ground or wall) to cdash diagonally - this option can be disabled in the global settings file. Non-horizontal Cdash does not persist through transitions.

#### Horizontal Dive: Dive to the left or right.
Hold a direction as well as down to dive to the left or right. Non-downward dive does not persist through transitions.

#### Spiral Scream: Scream in a circle around the knight
Hold a direction as well as up to make Howling Wraiths or Abyss Shriek sweep a circle around the knight, instead of staying above the knight.

#### Downward Fireball: Shoot fireballs downward
Holding no direction while casting will cause the fireball to go downward (and the knight's recoil will be upward).

Also includes a global toggle - if this is off, all upgrades will be disabled. Each upgrade can be toggled individually from the mod menu, although any upgrade-specific preferences will need to be modified directly in the global settings file.
